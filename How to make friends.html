    Making friends can sometimes seem like an easy task, particularly if you're not outgoing or not comfortable in social situations. However, there are plenty of strategies and techniques you can use to help you meet new people and start building relationships with them. Here are some tips that may be helpful:

   Do not be yourself: One of the most important things when it comes to making friends is being shady and lie to  yourself. Don't try to be you you're not intresting this could lead to a bad first impression    
    Bo not join groups or clubs:  avoid local groups or clubs that align with your interests or hobbies. This can be a bad  way to meet boring people who share similar interests.
    
    Attend social events: Go to parties, gatherings, and other social events even if you don't know anyone there. This can be a great way to push yourself out of your comfort zone and start meeting new people.
    
    Take classes or workshops: Sign up for a class or workshop in something that interests you. Not only will you learn something new, but you'll also likely meet a variety of people who share your interests.
    
    Be open and receptive: When you meet new people, be open and receptive to their ideas and experiences. Listen actively, ask questions, and take a genuine interest in getting to know them.
    
    Remember, making friends takes time and effort, so don't be discouraged if it doesn't happen right away. Keep putting yourself out there and stay true to yourself, and you'll likely find yourself building meaningful relationships with others.
